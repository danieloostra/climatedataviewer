***Why support this project?

The goal for this repository is to open the CDV to the world via GitHub, to help us create the ultimate data visualization tool that our scientists, educators, friends and families can connect with the hundreds of petabytes of data that are provided freely by science teams at NASA, NOAA, CDC, NWS without politics or strings attached.

***What does this software already do?

The Climate Data Viewer (CDV) is a web server that can be configured to allow users to access climate and Earth science data. The CDV uses DODs networking to enable data users to view distributed datasets in one viewer, or host data locally. The CDV uses the Ferret visualization engine to visualize data within the CDV, however, other applications such as Matlab, IDL, GrADS can also be used within the CDV as it currently stands.

The CDV can also be used to visualize other data, on other servers throughout the world. The CDV has been used by NOAA, NASA, and other governmental agencies to visualize data, providing an easy-to-use way to access geo-referenced scientific data.

***What can I do?

Recent developments have forced individual users to introduce the CDV (also known as the Live Access Server - LAS) into a mainstream crowd-sourced software package, to insure the safety of its’ use by current and future users. What really needs to happen here is that you need to help make the CDV bombproof. If you have a background in securing Java based applications against attacks such as XSS, Command Injection, SQL-injection or related vulnerabilities, *please lend a hand in making this software as secure as you can. *

***Who initially developed the CDV?

The Climate Data Viewer was originally developed by the dedicated staff at the PMEL – Pacific Marine Environmental Lab, with all credit going to them for the initial, current, and on-going development. I’ve been in close contact with lead developer at PMEL, and we will share any concrete developments with the team at PMEL for evaluation and feedback.
